				<p>I am a young student eager to learn and discover the world. I am currently studying for a bachelor’s degree in business school at Audencia, and I'm very happy there. Interested in everything that surrounds me, I want to immerse myself little by little in the world of work so that I can better project myself into the future. For now, my goal is to have as many experiences as possible. Whether personal, professional, academic, social or cultural experiences. At the end of my three years of bachelor' degree, I would probably like to continue towards a master's degree, because of my love of learning. Maybe in one of the major international business and management schools, maybe specialize in communication, design or marketing, or maybe in finance. I don't really know right now. Only time will tell. That's who I am, nice to meet you !</p>
